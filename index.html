    <h1>Hi there, I'm Mateo Guaman!</h1>
    <p>I'm an Electrical Engineering student at Tufts University. <a href="/about">Read more about my life</a> or check out some of the <a href="/projects">projects</a> I've worked on!</p>

    <h2>S.A.M.: Semantic Autonomous Mapping</h2>
    <p>We created an autonomous semantic mapping functionality for a Turtlebot robot using ROS. It autonomously navigates the building given a set of waypoints. In real time, it detects the door signs in Halligan Hall and it runs optical character recognition using Google Cloud Vision to build a semantic representation of the building. Watch it roaming the building while gathering data <a href ="https://youtu.be/rgBgixom0Fc">here</a>. You can find a write-up for the project <a href="/files/sam.pdf">here</a>. </p>

    <h2>Smart Bike Lights</h2>
    <p>This has been a long ongoing project to build smart blinking and braking lights for my bike. It started at a makeathon, MakeHarvard 2018, where we didn't quite get them working, but we did win a prize for reverse engineering and documenting the behavior of the lights. You can see the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/smarter-bike-light">Devpost</a> for the project here, which includes the very detailed documentation that got us the prize! </p>
    <p>Since we didn't get the actual project working then, I took it upon myself to get the lights working. Over the summer, I worked on a Kalman Filter implementation to estimate the pose of the bike in all axes. Knowing the rall, pitch, and yaw of the bike, as well as the linear velocity and acceleration of the bike should allow me to implement braking lights as well as turning lights that automatically turn off after turning. Now, I have to get the thing attached to the bike.
