    <h2>S.A.M.: Semantic Autonomous Mapping</h2>
    <p>We created an autonomous semantic mapping functionality for a Turtlebot robot using ROS. It autonomously navigates the building given a set of waypoints. In real time, it detects the door signs in Halligan Hall and it runs optical character recognition using Google Cloud Vision to build a semantic representation of the building. Watch it roaming the building while gathering data <a href ="https://youtu.be/rgBgixom0Fc">here</a>. You can find a write-up for the project <a href="/files/sam.pdf">here</a>. </p>
