		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Hi! I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Quito, Ecuador. Currently I am studying Electrical Engineering at Tufts University, which means that I live in either Somerville or Medford, Massachusetts depending on the time of the year, right outside of Boston.</p>
		<p>As of the summer of 2017, I am an intern at Tufts University's <a href="http://ceeo.tufts.edu">Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a> building some cool IoT devices and helping create a local network of IoT devices that can be used to develop and showcase the IoT capabilities of the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3. For example, I have built an Arduino-based IoT sign for Dr Ethan Danahy's Lab that changes colors, a controller for said sign on an EV3 running <a href="http://www.ev3dev.org">ev3dev</a>, a small Raspberry Pi circuit that can control both Dr. E's sign and Philip Hue lightbulbs, and a few more things.</p>
		<p>I am also currently working at Tufts University's CRISP (Controls, Robotics, Identification, and Signal Processing) Lab under <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~khan/">Professor Usman Khan</a>. My current project involves building a land robot that can detect a certain object and navigate to it using computer vision. This robot is controlled from a Raspberry Pi communicating through <a href="http://www.ros.org">ROS</a> (Robot Operating System) to an Arduino, which is in charge of controlling the motors and reading the sensors. One of the secondary goals of this project is communicating with a drone being developed at the lab through ROS in real time so that they can collaborate to reach a certain goal. This project has exposed me to a ton of technologies such as ROS, IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), filtering the data coming from the IMU, quaternions,  and control loops. Although I am still by no means an expert on any of these topics, I certainly look forward to learning more about them in the future.</p>
		<p>In my free time I like to bike around Boston, play the piano, and explore the lovely city I live in.</p>
