		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Hi! I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Quito, Ecuador. Currently I am studying Electrical Engineering at Tufts University, which means that I live right outside of Boston in either Somerville or Medford, Massachusetts depending on the time of the year.</p>

		<p>In my free time I like to bike around Boston, play the piano, and explore the lovely city I live in.</p>
