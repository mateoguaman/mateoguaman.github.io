		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Hi! I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Quito, Ecuador. Currently I am studying Electrical Engineering at Tufts University, which means that I live in either Somerville or Medford, Massachusetts depending on the time of the year, right outside of Boston.</p>
		<p>As of the summer of 2017, I am an intern at Tufts University's <a href="http://ceeo.tufts.edu" target="_blank">Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a> (CEEO) building some cool IoT devices and helping create a local network of IoT devices that can be used to develop and showcase the IoT capabilities of the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3. For example, I have built an Arduino-based IoT sign for <a href="http://ceeo.tufts.edu/people/danahy.htm" target="_blank">Dr. Ethan Danahy's</a> Lab that changes colors, a controller for said sign on an EV3 running <a href="http://www.ev3dev.org" target="_blank">ev3dev</a>, a small Raspberry Pi circuit that can control both Dr. E's sign and Philip Hue lightbulbs, and a few more things. I also got to mentor a workshop for 38 Japanese High School kids that taught them about client-based product development using an approach called <a href="http://www.novelengineering.org" target="_blank">Novel Engineering</a> that was developed at the CEEO and LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 based robotics. It was very interesting to see how letting each one of the groups decide how they wanted to tackle the given problem led to them having very different approaches to a seemingly straight-forward problem.</p>
		<p>I am also currently working at Tufts University's CRISP (Controls, Robotics, Identification, and Signal Processing) Lab under <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~khan/" target="_blank">Professor Usman Khan</a>. My current project involves building a land robot that can detect a certain object and navigate to it using computer vision. This robot is controlled from a Raspberry Pi communicating through <a href="http://www.ros.org" target="_blank">ROS</a> (Robot Operating System) to an Arduino, which is in charge of controlling the motors and reading the sensors. One of the secondary goals of this project is communicating with a drone being developed at the lab through ROS in real time so that they can collaborate to reach a certain goal. This project has exposed me to a ton of technologies such as ROS, IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), filtering the data coming from the IMU, quaternions,  and control loops. Although I am still by no means an expert on any of these topics, I certainly look forward to learning more about them in the future.</p>
		<p>In my free time I like to bike around Boston, play the piano, and explore the lovely city I live in.</p>
