	<h2>Dr E's Sign</h2>
	<p>Arduino-based IoT sign for Dr. Ethan Danahy's Lab that changes colors and that can be controlled from 
	any device capable of sending HTTP requests inside the local network. It was built to showcase the educational capabilities that the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot could have if combined with Internet of Things technology. This local network involved a Raspberry Pi, different types of analog circuits with different sensors connected to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi, Philips HUE lightbulbs, and the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot. </p>

	<h2>CRISP Lab Land Robot</h2>
	<p> This robot is controlled from a Raspberry Pi communicating through ROS (Robot Operating System) to an Arduino, which is in charge of controlling the motors and reading the sensors. One of the secondary goals of this project is communicating with a drone being developed at the lab through ROS in real time so that they can collaborate to reach a certain goal. This project has exposed me to a ton of technologies such as ROS, IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), filtering the data coming from the IMU, quaternions, and control loops. Although I am still by no means an expert on any of these topics, I certainly look forward to learning more about them in the future.</p>

	<h1>Attempted projects</h1>
	<h2>Spotify Playlist Generator</h2>
	<p>Project for Polyhack 2017. Consisted of developing a Spotify playlist generator using Spotify's API in Javascript. It would generate playlists that would go with the mood of the locations where you spent time at. We tried using Google Spreadsheets to save data that would be collected using a Chrome extension. Then, we tried to build a visualization tool using Google Maps' API. Sadly, we got a bit stuck trying to grant access to an account with OAuth from a chrome extension. Not bad for a first hackathon, but will definitely come back to it as soon as possible.</p>
