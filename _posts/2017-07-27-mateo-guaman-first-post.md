Here are some of my favorite landscape photos I took in 2017.

<p>My dad convinced me to sign up for a 20km cross-country race in Santo Domingo, Ecuador, when I went back home for summer break. We went up slippery hills covered in river stones, and down muddy, narrow trails with precipice to my left and right sides. A bit of the race involved going through a banana plantation that had a very slippery clay ground. Little did he tell me that we would be crossing FIVE rivers by bike (or foot, like I did for some of them) over the course of the race. This is one of those rivers.</p>

<p>When I came back to start my sophomore year, my dad came with me from Ecuador and I took him for a little adventure in Boston. We biked from MIT to the Charles Esplanade, all the way to Allston and back. Sunsets at the Charles are magical.</p>

<p>I was in my dorm, blinds closed, and when I walked into the hallway, I just saw a purple light coming in from the window, which prompted me to run outside as fast as I could to watch the most gorgeous sunset I've ever seen. That was followed by me biking like a maniac around campus to try to find the best spot to capture the sunset from, but it turns out that the best view was actually from my dorm</p>
